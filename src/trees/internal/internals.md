# Part II: zkVM Internals

- in this second part of the book, we introduce the basic concepts that underlie the construction of zkVMs
- that is, we answer the question "How do zkVMs work internally?"
- of course, each zkVM team made different design decisions and the different zkVMs work in different ways
- however, there are some shared core principles underlying their design, and we want to explain those
- the goal is not that the reader learns exactly how a specific zkVM works, but rather that the reader learns the basic concepts and can later dive deeper into details of a specific zkVM (which is not in the scope of this book)

- we could reuse [this doc by Cody](https://linear.app/zkevm/document/zkevm-pipeline-322681ad89b4) here (or in an overview subsection)
