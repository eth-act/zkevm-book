# Security Considerations


- give an intuition for why the steps are "secure" / preserve knowledge soundness
- refer to works that have studied the security formally, for the interested reader
- talk about bit security: what it means, how you show it, difference between interactive and non-interactive, ROM, etc.
- refer to security document (if already exists)
