# Preconditions for Integrating zkEVMs
> Note. Section under construction
- are there some changes that we need to make to the Ethereum protocol before we can move to zkEVMs?
- What are the constraints to make this work in practice, e.g., how fast must proving be?
    * define real-time proving here?
- collect a list of open questions that we need to answer before we can have zkEVMs on L1
