# Problems Addressed by zkEVMs


- list some problems that the Ethereum protocol has right now and explain briefly how zkEVMs solve them
- we could have individual sections for these problems later, and explain there how exactly they are solved
- we should maybe also have a big picture section where it all comes together (related to soispoke's hackmd and maybe this should be the "architecture" section?)
