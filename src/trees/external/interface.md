# zkEVM Interface
Before exploring how zkEVMs can enhance the Ethereum protocol, we first clarify what they are.
Specifically, we define the functionality they offer by outlining their syntax and interfaces, as well as their security and efficiency properties.
With this definition in place, we can treat zkEVMs as a black box throughout the remainder of this part.

## Syntactical Interface
- what is the interface of the zkEVM? (e.g., inputs and outputs of prove and of verify)

- use Kev's "execution proof" abstraction

> **Remark:**  refer to ere as an example that unifies the interface, say that this is important if we want to use them and compare them.

## Semantical Properties
- what are the properties that they provide?
> **Remark:**  note that they are not zk!

### Completeness

### Soundness and Knowledge Soundness

### Succinctness

> **Remark:** zkVMs vs zkEVMs vs SNARKs TODO.
