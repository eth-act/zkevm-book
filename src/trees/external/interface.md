# zkEVM Interface
Before exploring how zkEVMs can enhance the Ethereum protocol, we first clarify what they are.
Specifically, we define the functionality they offer by outlining their syntax and interfaces, as well as their security and efficiency properties.
With this definition in place, we can treat zkEVMs as a black box throughout the remainder of this part.

> **Remark:** We sometimes use the terms *zkVM* and *zkEVM* interchangeably, although they historically have a slightly different meaning: while a zkVM can prove the execution of a general program, a zkEVM was meant to prove the execution of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Our definition is actually closer to a zkVM, but the programs that we input will be Ethereum clients.

## Intuition
At a high level, zkEVMs provide a *proof of correct execution*.

Imagine two parties: a powerful *prover*, Alice, and a less powerful *verifier*, Bob.
Both agree on a function `f` â€” for example, one implemented in Rust.
They also share an input `x` and an output `y`, and Alice claims that `f(x) = y`.

How can Bob be confident this claim is correct?

- *Naive solution.* Bob could re-execute `f` on input `x` himself, but this might be prohibitively expensive.
- *Succinct argument solution.* Instead, Alice can produce [*succinct non-interactive argument* (SNARG)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/610.pdf), which convinces Bob that `f(x) = y`. "Succinct" here means that the argument is small in size and inexpensive to verify - much cheaper than full re-execution.

SNARGs are fascinating cryptographic constructs, and remarkably, they can be built efficiently [and unconditionally in the random oracle model](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/116.pdf).
For now, we treat SNARGs as given.

Importantly, because SNARGs are non-interactive, the proof that a single powerful prover Alice computes, can be used to convince *arbitrarily many verifiers* Bob.

## Syntactical Interface
Let us now be more precise, and define the interface that a zkEVM provides.


- use ERE style definition

> **Remark:**  refer to ere as an example that unifies the interface, say that this is important if we want to use them and compare them.

## Semantical Properties
- what are the properties that they provide?
> **Remark:**  note that they are not zk!
