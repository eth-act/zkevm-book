# Introduction

- we should have a small motivation here, focusing on the high level goal: scaling Ethereum execution throughput
- why can't we simply increase the gas limit?
- we should explain how the book is structured
    * three parts:
      1. how is zkEVM used in Ethereum? (general audience)
      2. how are zkVMs constructed? (general audience)
      3. how can one play around with them? (specific audiences per subpart: client devs...)
    * each part also mentions open questions and problems
