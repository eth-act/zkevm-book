# Introduction

- we should have a small motivation here, focusing on the high level goal: scaling Ethereum execution throughput
- we should explain how the book is structured
    * three parts: (1) how is zkEVM used in Ethereum? (2) how are zkVMs constructed? (3) how can one play around with them?
    * each part also mentions open questions and problems
